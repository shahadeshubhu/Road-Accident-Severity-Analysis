# Road-Accident-Severity-Analysis
Analyzed UK road accident data to predict severity using ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and tuned LightGBM. Applied EDA, feature engineering, SMOTE, class weighting, and hyperparameter tuning. Used DBSCAN to identify accident hotspots. Best model achieved macro F1 of 0.42 and 19.3% recall for fatal accidents.
